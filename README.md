# ML Reading List

This is a repository of the fundamental papers that have shaped the current AI industry. Here you can find a list of papers and my explanations and intutions I've built for each of the paper as I go.

You can find all the resources collated in a [notion page hosted here](https://www.notion.so/100-paper-challenge-aa0e53fcc7e24fe4bddd145bbb02d2b6) ðŸ‘‡
